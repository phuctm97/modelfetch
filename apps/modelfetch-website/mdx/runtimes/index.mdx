ModelFetch provides runtime-specific packages that handle the platform details while you focus on building your MCP server functionality. Each package is optimized for its target runtime while maintaining a consistent API.

## Common API

All runtime packages share the same simple API:

```typescript
import handle from "@modelfetch/runtime";
import server from "./server";

handle(server, (address) => {
  console.log(`Server running at: ${address}`);
});
```

## Choosing a Runtime

### Node.js

Choose Node.js when:

- You need the largest ecosystem of packages
- Your team is familiar with Node.js
- You're integrating with existing Node.js applications
- You need specific Node.js APIs or modules

### Bun

Choose Bun when:

- You want the fastest startup and runtime performance
- You prefer built-in TypeScript support
- You value an all-in-one toolkit (runtime, package manager, bundler)
- You're building performance-critical applications

### Deno

Choose Deno when:

- Security is a top priority (permissions model)
- You want built-in TypeScript and modern JavaScript features
- You prefer web standard APIs
- You need built-in development tools (formatter, linter, test runner)

### Cloudflare

Choose Cloudflare when:

- You want global edge deployment with ultra-low latency
- You need zero cold starts and instant scaling
- You're building stateful applications with Durable Objects
- You want to leverage Cloudflare's ecosystem (KV, R2, D1, Workers AI)

### Vercel

Choose Vercel when:

- You're deploying to Vercel's infrastructure
- You want serverless MCP endpoints
- You need both Edge Runtime and Node.js Runtime options
- You're building Next.js applications with MCP integration

### Netlify

Choose Netlify when:

- You're deploying to Netlify's infrastructure
- You want serverless Functions with generous free tier
- You need background functions for long-running tasks
- You're building JAMstack applications

## Installation

Each runtime has its own package:

### Node.js

```bash
npm install @modelfetch/node
```

### Bun

```bash
bun add @modelfetch/bun
```

### Deno

```bash
deno add jsr:@modelfetch/deno
```

### Cloudflare

```bash
npm install @modelfetch/cloudflare
```

### Vercel

```bash
npm install @modelfetch/vercel
```

### Netlify

```bash
npm install @modelfetch/netlify
```

## Server Compatibility

The MCP server code remains identical across all runtimes:

```typescript
import { McpServer } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js";
import { z } from "zod";

const server = new McpServer({
  title: "My MCP Server",
  name: "my-server",
  version: "1.0.0",
});

// Define tools, resources, and prompts
server.tool(
  "roll_dice",
  "Rolls an N-sided dice",
  { sides: z.number().int().min(2) },
  ({ sides }) => ({
    content: [
      {
        type: "text",
        text: `🎲 You rolled a ${1 + Math.floor(Math.random() * sides)}!`,
      },
    ],
  }),
);

export default server;
```

Only the runtime handler import changes:

- `@modelfetch/node` for Node.js
- `@modelfetch/bun` for Bun
- `@modelfetch/deno` for Deno
- `@modelfetch/cloudflare` for Cloudflare Workers
- `@modelfetch/vercel` for Vercel Functions
- `@modelfetch/netlify` for Netlify Functions

## Development Workflow

All runtimes support a similar development workflow:

1. **Create your MCP server** using the standard SDK
2. **Import the runtime handler** for your platform
3. **Run with your runtime's command**:
   - Node.js: `npx tsx index.ts`
   - Bun: `bun run index.ts`
   - Deno: `deno run -A index.ts`

## Future Runtimes

ModelFetch continues to expand runtime support. Additional runtimes will follow the same simple API pattern, making it easy to deploy your MCP servers anywhere.
